*Note: the ethernet and 433MHz transmitter modules are the ones provided by Fritzing, the real ones I used differ a bit (but you get the idea).*

### About
This project was started for my class Internet of Things at school.
If you want to read about the progress you can check out the [blog](http://smartroom.ignacemaes.com/) behind it (Dutch).
